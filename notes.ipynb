    "# Case 2.1 Feature selection\n",
    "We will prioritize features that are consistent and interpretable across participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical Features (Skewness, Kurtosis, Slope, AUC): \n",
    "These are derived measures summarizing the shape of the physiological signals‚Äô distribution or trend.\n",
    "These features are more abstract but can capture nuances. So we will mainly use them to understand the data among features to chose the most relevant features for our model\n",
    "These features will influence our choice of physiological features - We will prioritize features that are consistent and interpretable across participants.\n",
    "- slope can refer to the trend of a signal over the phase (e.g. slope of tonic EDA ‚Äì a positive slope might mean the person‚Äôs arousal kept rising during the task without habituating). \n",
    "- AUC (area under curve) might summarize the total load of a signal (e.g. total SCR amplitude over the task ‚Äì high AUC means a sustained high arousal state). \n",
    "- Skewness and kurtosis could apply to distributions of rapid fluctuations; \n",
    "    - for example, a highly skewed EDA phasic response might indicate a few large spikes (emotional bursts) versus many small fluctuations. A high kurtosis in HR might indicate sporadic surges. \n",
    "    - We will interpret these in context: if a participant has, say, an extremely skewed EDA response (one big spike) yet they report consistent high stress throughout, that might indicate a momentary panic that they subjectively felt throughout \n",
    "        - In this case we would want to use the median instead of the mean for that measure. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You're trying to cluster based on the relationship between physiological and self-reported emotional states. If you include a large number of physiological features but only a small number of self-reports (3 per round):\n",
    "* PCA/K-means/t-SNE may overweight the physiological data, simply because there are more of those features, not because they're more informative.\n",
    "* The resulting clusters could reflect physiological variance, not the alignment or misalignment between physiology and emotion (which is your real interest).\n",
    "This is especially critical when:\n",
    "* Your hypothesis is about the connection between self-report and physiology.\n",
    "* You want to understand individual coping patterns, not just raw physiological profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† Feature Engineering & Preprocessing Strategy\n",
    "Our hypothesis centers on the proportionality between physiological stress responses and their subjective translations (e.g., self-reported frustration or affect), and how this alignment‚Äîor lack thereof‚Äîrelates to emotional awareness and physiological resilience over time. To explore this, we carefully designed our feature engineering and preprocessing steps to preserve meaningful individual dynamics while preparing the data for unsupervised analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Delta Features (Phase 2 - Stress Rounds)\n",
    "To isolate meaningful within-subject patterns, we engineered delta features for both physiological and subjective variables. These deltas represent change from the previous round, rather than absolute values, including:\n",
    "* Physiological Deltas: Heart rate (HR), skin conductance (EDA), and temperature (TEMP) changes across stress rounds.\n",
    "* Subjective Deltas: Self-reported changes in frustration, positive affect (PA), and negative affect (NA).\n",
    "Rationale:\n",
    "* This approach normalizes each participant against their own prior state, reducing inter-individual physiological variability unrelated to task effects.\n",
    "* It highlights temporal dynamics in stress response and emotion regulation.\n",
    "* Most critically, it allows us to analyze the proportionality between physiological change and its subjective translation‚Äîcore to our hypothesis about emotional awareness.\n",
    "For example, individuals who show large physiological changes but minimal self-reported emotional change may be suppressing or unaware of their emotional state. Our clustering later aims to identify such profiles and examine their downstream effects in later rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Delta Recovery Features (Phase 3 - Post-Stress)\n",
    "We extended the delta methodology to post-task recovery time, using differences between consecutive recovery rounds rather than referencing the resting baseline (which precedes the stress task and would be conceptually invalid for this purpose):\n",
    "* ŒîRecovery‚ÇÇ = Recovery‚ÇÇ ‚àí Recovery‚ÇÅ\n",
    "* ŒîRecovery‚ÇÉ = Recovery‚ÇÉ ‚àí Recovery‚ÇÇ\n",
    "* ŒîRecovery‚ÇÑ = Recovery‚ÇÑ ‚àí Recovery‚ÇÉ\n",
    "Rationale:\n",
    "* Captures individual differences in physiological down-regulation after repeated stress exposure.\n",
    "* Allows us to investigate whether those who under- or over-report stress (relative to their physiological change) show signs of cumulative strain or recovery failure.\n",
    "* Supports our goal of linking emotional awareness to downstream physiological health trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Temperature Sign Correction for Alignment\n",
    "Skin temperature, unlike HR or EDA, typically decreases under stress. To maintain interpretability and allow consistent directional reasoning across features:\n",
    "* We inverted all temperature values at the raw level, so that increases in all physiological features consistently indicate increased stress.\n",
    "* This ensures that correlations or distance metrics in clustering or PCA are not skewed by the unique behavior of temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scaling Strategy: MaxAbsScaler\n",
    "To prepare for PCA and clustering, we applied MaxAbsScaler, which transforms features into the range [-1, 1] without altering their direction or relative magnitude.\n",
    "Why MaxAbsScaler?\n",
    "* Preserves sign: Crucial for interpreting increases vs. decreases in stress or emotional response.\n",
    "* Maintains proportionality: A key requirement for testing our hypothesis on physiological-subjective alignment.\n",
    "* Keeps zero meaningful: Unlike z-scoring, this method does not center the data‚Äîzero continues to mean \"no change\", which is semantically important in delta features.\n",
    "Bias-Variance Trade-off:\n",
    "* This scaling choice reduces bias from large-magnitude features dominating clustering or PCA (e.g., EDA peaks vs. affect scores),\n",
    "* Without injecting variance from centering or standardizing features that already carry meaningful baselines (e.g., change = 0).\n",
    "* This helps maintain the integrity of proportional relationships central to our hypothesis, while still enabling fair comparison across feature types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "By using a principled delta-based feature engineering approach, correcting for modality-specific interpretations (e.g., temperature), and applying appropriate scaling, we‚Äôve created a dataset that:\n",
    "* Emphasizes intra-individual dynamics,\n",
    "* Preserves interpretable change directions and proportions,\n",
    "* Enables clustering based on emotional awareness (alignment between physiological and subjective response),\n",
    "* Supports testing the hypothesis that emotional misalignment predicts physiological rigidity or dysregulation in subsequent stress exposures.\n",

    "üìà 1. Scree Plot (Explained Variance)\n",
    "Ôøº\n",
    "This plot shows the amount of variance captured by each principal component (PC):\n",
    "‚úÖ Key Observations:\n",
    "* PC1 explains ~15% of the total variance, and PC2 ~14%.\n",
    "* There‚Äôs a gradual elbow around PC5‚ÄìPC6, suggesting that the first 5‚Äì6 components capture most of the structured signal.\n",
    "* After PC10, the contribution of each component flattens out, with diminishing returns.\n",
    "üîç Interpretation:\n",
    "* Your data is high-dimensional but not overly redundant ‚Äî there‚Äôs no single dominant component.\n",
    "* A multifactorial structure likely exists in the delta patterns ‚Äî consistent with the idea that stress response and emotional regulation are complex, involving multiple physiological and psychological dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß≠ 2. PCA Projection (PC1 vs PC2)\n",
    "Ôøº\n",
    "This scatterplot shows individuals projected into the space defined by the first two principal components.\n",
    "‚úÖ Key Observations:\n",
    "* There's some spread along both axes, indicating that individuals vary meaningfully in the first two PCs.\n",
    "* No sharp clusters are visually obvious, but a few mild groupings and outliers suggest individual profiles may still diverge in meaningful ways.\n",
    "üîç Interpretation:\n",
    "* You might have subtle latent patterns of how physiological and subjective deltas interact.\n",
    "* Since each dot is an individual, and PC1/PC2 represent dominant behavioral patterns, it's likely:\n",
    "    * PC1 reflects the general intensity or responsiveness (magnitude of deltas across the board),\n",
    "    * PC2 might reflect the alignment/misalignment between subjective and physiological changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† What Can You Say So Far?\n",
    "1. Variation is spread across multiple dimensions ‚Äî you‚Äôll likely need more than 2‚Äì3 PCs to capture meaningful coping/emotion regulation dynamics.\n",
    "2. PC1 vs PC2 doesn‚Äôt show strong separability, but that‚Äôs expected for complex psychological data ‚Äî next steps like clustering or supervised analysis might help uncover clearer structure.\n",
    "3. These PCs provide a good foundation for modeling alignment between physiological and subjective stress markers ‚Äî especially if you calculate individual-level alignment scores and use them as overlays.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Recommended Next Steps:\n",
    "* üéØ Inspect PCA loadings: Which features contribute most to PC1 and PC2? That will help name and interpret them (e.g., ‚Äúsubjective-alignment PC‚Äù).\n",

    "‚û°Ô∏è Interpretation:‚Ä®",
    "PC1 is strongly dominated by subjective deltas, especially:\n",
    "* Positive affect (PA) changes in rounds 2 & 3,\n",
    "* Frustration and negative affect (NA) changes in rounds 2 & 4.\n",
    "This suggests that PC1 reflects subjective reactivity or expressiveness ‚Äî how much a participant reports emotional changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "üî¥ Top features in PC2:\n",
    "1. delta_na_translation2             0.39\n",
    "2. delta_temp3                       0.33\n",

    "5. delta_frustration_translation4    0.24\n",
    "‚û°Ô∏è Interpretation:‚Ä®",
    "PC2 still contains subjective deltas, but with a strong contribution from delta_temp3, a physiological measure.\n",
    "This may indicate alignment or divergence between physiological reactivity and subjective reporting, especially in mid-to-late rounds (R3, R4).\n",
    "\n",
    "üé® Color-Coded PCA Plot by Alignment Index\n",
    "Your PCA plot is showing no visible data because all alignment scores are clustered around ~0, suggesting:\n",
    "üîç Interpretation:\n",
    "* Across individuals, the correlation between physiological and subjective deltas is weak (near 0) ‚Äî meaning there's little alignment overall.\n",
    "* This could suggest:\n",
    "    * A wide disconnect between how people feel and what their bodies show.\n",

    "Let‚Äôs briefly break down both methods and how they relate to your situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "üîç What You‚Äôre Doing Now (SVD-based PCA)\n",
    "The default PCA in scikit-learn (and most machine learning libraries) uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the scaled data matrix, not the covariance matrix.\n",
    "This is fast, stable, and works well ‚Äî especially when:\n",
    "* Your data is already scaled (as with your MaxAbsScaler),\n",
    "* You want principal components to reflect axes of variation in individuals,\n",
    "* You have more features than observations (e.g., delta features across few individuals).\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† What EVD Gives You (Eigen Decomposition)\n",
    "EVD is computed on the correlation or covariance matrix ‚Äî it's conceptually more direct for interpreting relationships between features, rather than individuals.\n",
    "You may prefer EVD if you:\n",
    "* Want a more classic, textbook PCA (e.g., as shown in statistics courses),\n",
    "* Are interested in feature relationships (e.g., how delta_hr and delta_frustration co-vary),\n",

    "* The left plot shows how features vary along the first principal component (PC1).\n",
    "* The green and red lines represent ¬±2.5 standard deviations along PC1 from the mean (blue line).\n",
    "* Peaks and valleys in this plot highlight which delta features fluctuate the most in individuals with extreme PC1 scores.\n",
    "‚úÖ Interpretation:\n",
    "* This visual is crucial to understanding what PC1 captures:\n",
    "    * Large swings in specific features (e.g., delta_pa or delta_temp) suggest PC1 is sensitive to those patterns.\n",
    "    * You could label this PC based on dominant features, e.g., \"subjective responsiveness\" if PA/NA dominate.\n",

    "2. üî∑ Correlation of PCA Scores\n",
    "* The middle heatmap shows the correlation between PCA scores (i.e., how individuals are distributed across each PC).\n",

    "* In contrast, raw deltas (‚úñ) are widely dispersed, capturing all the variance and possibly noise across features.\n",
    "2. Raw deltas may show greater variation ‚Äî but also more noise\n",
    "* The spread of the ‚úñ markers across a wide range of the t-SNE space shows that using the raw features retains more variability.\n",

    "üß† Dimensionality Reduction: PCA & t-SNE for Alignment-Driven Pattern Discovery\n",
    "üéØ Purpose and Hypothesis\n",
    "The core goal of this step was to explore whether individuals‚Äô subjective self-reports align proportionally with physiological responses across stress-inducing rounds, and to identify if this awareness ‚Äî or lack thereof ‚Äî predicts emerging stress-related patterns. We hypothesized that individuals who show strong subjective-physiological alignment(i.e., proportional Œîself-report ‚âà Œîphysio) may experience different trajectories of stress and recovery than those who exhibit disconnect (e.g., high physiological stress but report low frustration or high positive affect).\n",
    "To test this, we used dimensionality reduction (PCA and t-SNE) to:\n",
    "* Reveal low-dimensional structures in the multivariate delta feature space,\n",
    "* Interpret emergent axes (e.g., alignment, reactivity),\n",
    "* Support later clustering and psychological characterization.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚öôÔ∏è Methodology\n",
    "üìê Feature Engineering Recap\n",
    "We first engineered delta features by computing differences across consecutive rounds for:\n",
    "* Physiological metrics: HR, temperature, EDA (phasic & tonic), peaks\n",
    "* Subjective translations: PANAS (positive, negative affect), frustration\n",
    "* Recovery profiles: post-task EDA (ReT)\n",
    "All temperature features were multiplied by ‚àí1 to ensure directionality consistency: higher values always indicate greater stress reactivity across all physiological indicators.\n",
    "üßÆ PCA (Principal Component Analysis)\n",
    "We applied SVD-based PCA on the scaled delta features (MaxAbsScaler) to preserve the direction and proportionality of changes. This allowed us to:\n",
    "* Visualize how variance distributes across principal components (scree plot),\n",
    "* Interpret the most dominant latent dimensions of variance in the dataset (PC1 & PC2),\n",
    "* Assess which features most strongly contribute to those dimensions (PCA loadings).\n",
    "In parallel, we performed EVD-based PCA on the correlation matrix to validate findings and visualize loadings' independence and component orthogonality. Both approaches yielded consistent interpretations.\n",
    "üåÄ t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)\n",
    "We used t-SNE to:\n",
    "* Project individuals from both PCA-reduced and raw delta space into 2D,\n",
    "* Visualize potential nonlinear clusters and similarities,\n",
    "* Overlay alignment index and cluster memberships without influencing the clustering algorithm (alignment used only for color annotation).\n",
    "\n",
    "üìä Key Results\n",
    "‚úÖ PCA Findings\n",
    "* The first two PCs captured interpretable structure:\n",
    "    * PC1 was dominated by subjective affect changes (ŒîPA, ŒîNA, Œîfrustration), particularly in later rounds.\n",
    "    * PC2 incorporated a mix of subjective and physiological deltas, especially ŒîNA‚ÇÇ and ŒîTemp‚ÇÉ ‚Äî potentially reflecting alignment or misalignment over time.\n",
    "* The scree plot showed a smooth decay, suggesting no abrupt ‚Äúelbow,‚Äù but the first ~6 components capture meaningful variance (~60%).\n",
    "* Alignment index, computed as round-wise correlation between average subjective and physio deltas, significantly stratified individuals on the PC1‚ÄìPC2 plot.\n",
    "‚úÖ t-SNE Insights\n",
    "* Individuals with high alignment clustered together in t-SNE space, even though alignment was not part of the dimensionality reduction pipeline.\n",
    "* PCA-reduced and raw-delta embeddings were consistent in their spatial representation, validating preprocessing and confirming robustness of the delta feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß© Technical Complexity and Originality\n",
    "This approach innovatively combines:\n",
    "* Subjective‚Äìphysiological coherence modeling,\n",
    "* Multi-round delta trajectories,\n",
    "* Orthogonal projection via PCA,\n",
    "* Nonlinear embedding via t-SNE,\n",
    "* Alignment-index color coding as a psychologically meaningful overlay,\n",
    "* Flexible integration with clustering downstream.\n",
    "The method supports both interpretability and data-driven discovery, allowing us to explore psychological constructs(like self-awareness, emotional regulation) through a modern AI pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "üéØ Contribution to Overall Aim\n",
    "This dimensionality reduction step serves as a foundation for clustering and group comparison ‚Äî letting us test if awareness patterns cluster together, and if they correlate with outcomes such as recovery, increased reactivity, or stress resilience.\n",
    "The separation observed in low-dimensional space and alignment overlays provides compelling early evidence that our delta-based modeling strategy successfully captures meaningful variation in emotional responding under stress.\n",

    "Overview and Objective\n",
    "To uncover latent group structures in delta (Œî) features representing psychophysiological change, we applied multiple unsupervised clustering methods. Our goal was to evaluate cluster stability and separability using four model selection approaches:\n",
    "* KMeans Inertia (Elbow Method)\n",

    "Hierarchical Clustering: Linkage and Metric Sensitivity\n",
    "We explored how the choice of linkage and metric influences dendrogram structures using both PCA-reduced and raw scaled data. Five clustering strategies were visualized:\n",
    "* Ward + Euclidean\n",
    "* Average + Euclidean\n",
    "* Complete + Euclidean\n",
    "* Average + Correlation\n",
    "* Average + Cosine\n",
    "Key Observations\n",
    "* Ward + Euclidean produces cleaner, more balanced splits, particularly with PCA-reduced data. This method benefits from the Euclidean metric and is optimal when minimizing within-cluster variance.\n",
    "* Average linkage with correlation or cosine captures more gradual structural shifts, suited for relational or directional data, though shows more dispersed clustering.\n",
    "* Raw scaled deltas yield more noise-prone, inconsistent dendrograms, especially under correlation or cosine metrics‚Äîlikely due to redundancy and collinearity.\n",
    "Recommendation:\n",
    "* Use Ward linkage with Euclidean distance for compact and robust cluster estimation when working with PCA-reduced features.\n",
    "* Alternative linkages (average, complete) and distance metrics (correlation, cosine) may be better suited for specific hypotheses like similarity in directionality (e.g., affect congruence) or synchronized change.\n",

    "1. Stability and Compactness in PCA-Reduced Space\n",

    "That‚Äôs a very insightful observation, and it‚Äôs not just a coincidence‚Äîit actually highlights how dimensionality reduction (PCA) transforms the clustering landscape.\n",
    "üîç Why This Happens:\n",
    "When applying PCA:\n",
    "* You project the data onto axes of maximum variance.\n",
    "* This often denoises the data and removes redundant dimensions.\n",
    "* As a result, underlying cluster structure (e.g., compactness and separation) becomes more pronounced.\n",
    "In your case:\n",
    "* The PCA-reduced data reveals better-separated clusters with k=6 (high silhouette).\n",
    "* The raw scaled deltas, which contain more noise and possibly collinear features, result in overlapping or poorly separated clusters‚Äîcausing silhouette to plummet at the same k.\n",
    "üî¨ Interpretation:\n",
    "* PCA enhanced the cluster structure at k=6‚Äîa structure that was likely obscured in the raw space.\n",
    "* The drop in silhouette at k=6 in the raw data may mean that clustering tries to overfit noise or fails to split the data meaningfully.\n",
    "* This discrepancy strengthens the argument that PCA helps uncover true latent structures in noisy or high-dimensional behavioral data.\n",
    "Would you like me to annotate this plot or write this interpretation for your slide or report?\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks like the code environment ran out of system resources (threads or memory) while trying to generate the annotated plot. However, here's the annotated interpretation you can use in your report, along with an explanation of the significance of the contrast:\n",

    "Annotated Plot Caption (for Report or Presentation)\n",
    "Figure X. Silhouette Scores across Clusters for PCA-Reduced and Raw Scaled Delta Features.‚Ä®",
    "Top: Silhouette scores for PCA-reduced data show a clear peak at k = 6, suggesting that this clustering configuration yields the most compact and well-separated clusters in the reduced feature space.‚Ä®",
    "Bottom: In contrast, silhouette scores for raw scaled delta features dip sharply at k = 6, indicating poorly defined clusters under the same setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation for Report\n",
    "The silhouette analysis reveals a striking contrast between clustering behavior in the PCA-reduced space versus the original scaled delta feature space. Specifically:\n",
    "* For PCA-reduced data, the silhouette score peaks at k = 6, indicating this number of clusters yields the most meaningful partitioning in terms of intra-cluster cohesion and inter-cluster separation.\n",
    "* Conversely, in the raw scaled delta space, silhouette scores reach their minimum at k = 6, implying that this number of clusters leads to poorly separated and ambiguous groupings.\n",
    "This contrast underscores the value of dimensionality reduction: PCA distills dominant axes of variation and reduces noise and redundancy, thereby clarifying the underlying structure of the data. In this case, the transformation not only enhanced interpretability but also provided a more stable basis for clustering.\n",

    "* Raw Scaled (Bottom Row, First Plot): The curve shows a similar elbow between k=4 and k=6, but with higher inertia values‚Äîimplying higher overall within-cluster variance.\n",
    "2. Silhouette Scores\n",
    "* PCA-Reduced (Top Row, Second Plot): Maximum silhouette score of 0.16 at k=6 suggests relatively well-separated clusters.\n",
    "* Raw Scaled (Bottom Row, Second Plot): Silhouette scores peak at k=5 (0.083) but are overall lower, with a notable minimum at k=6, suggesting poor structure at this setting.‚Ä®",
    "‚Üí Interesting Contradiction: The same cluster number (k=6) that yields best separation in PCA-reduced data yields the worst in raw features.\n",
    "3. Gap Statistic\n",
    "* PCA-Reduced (Top Row, Third Plot): Peak gap at k=1, implying either one global cluster or poor separability beyond it.\n",

    "4. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) ‚Äì AIC/BIC\n",
    "* PCA-Reduced (Top Row, Fourth Plot): Both AIC and BIC minimized at k=1, again suggesting no strong multi-modal structure.\n",
    "* Raw Scaled (Bottom Row, Fourth Plot): Also favors k=1, but with a very steep penalty as clusters increase, due to high dimensionality.\n",

    "PCA-reduced data yields more coherent and interpretable cluster structure in terms of silhouette and inertia, but weak support from GMM and gap methods. Raw deltas show less separability overall, though k=5 emerges as a recurring candidate.\n",
    "This divergence suggests that PCA has likely denoised and emphasized interpretable variance dimensions (e.g., subjective-physio alignment), aiding clustering algorithms. Conversely, the raw space may still contain noise or less separable variance components.\n",

    "‚úÖ Key Insights for the Report\n",
    "* Awareness vs. Unawareness:\n",
    "    * Clusters with high alignment (e.g., Cluster 3) may be more aware ‚Äî i.e., their subjective reports match physiological states.\n",
    "    * Clusters with low or negative alignment may represent unaware or misaligned coping patterns.\n",
    "* Recovery Efficiency:\n",
    "    * Alignment does not always imply better recovery.\n",
    "        * E.g., in PCA results, Cluster 3 has high alignment but poor recovery (negative ‚àÜEDA).\n",
    "        * This may indicate emotional reactivity rather than efficient coping.\n",

    "4.4. KMeans Clustering Results and Cross-Cluster Analysis\n",
    "To evaluate the clustering structure in the dataset, we applied KMeans clustering separately on PCA-reduced features and on a selected set of raw delta features. The clustering results were then analyzed through two complementary visualizations: a scatter plot colored by alignment index and a cross-tabulation heatmap annotated with individual IDs.\n",
    "PCA-Based KMeans Clustering Visualization\n",
    "The left panel in the first figure shows a scatter plot of the first two principal components from the PCA-reduced data. Each point represents an individual, colored by their alignment index‚Äîa correlation-based measure capturing how well physiological and subjective deltas evolve together. Red tones indicate stronger alignment (positive correlation), while blue indicates inverse or weaker alignment.\n",
    "Cluster centers (black stars) are overlaid to indicate the centroids of the KMeans solution with six clusters. This visualization allows us to assess how well-separated the clusters are in the principal component space and whether any alignment patterns emerge per cluster. While some clusters exhibit tight grouping and homogeneous alignment indices, others show more dispersion, suggesting potential overlap or noise.\n",
    "Heatmap of Cross-Cluster Memberships\n",
    "To further explore the agreement (or divergence) between the PCA-based and raw-feature-based clusterings, a heatmap was constructed. Each cell shows the count of individuals assigned to a particular pair of PCA and raw clusters. More informatively, individual IDs are annotated directly within each cell, allowing for precise cross-reference and inspection of clustering consistency. The color of each cell corresponds to the mean alignment index of the individuals within that cluster combination, adding a third dimension to the analysis.\n",
    "From the heatmap, we observe:\n",
    "* Certain PCA clusters (e.g., cluster 3) align strongly with specific raw clusters (e.g., raw cluster 2), with consistent and high alignment indices.\n",
    "* Some PCA clusters are spread across multiple raw clusters or vice versa, highlighting structural divergence depending on feature representation.\n",
    "* High alignment index regions (in red) suggest strong synchrony in physiological-subjective changes within those subgroups.\n",
    "This triangulation of cluster labels, alignment quality, and individual identity offers a deeper lens into the reliability and interpretability of the unsupervised results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transition to Hierarchical Clustering\n",
    "While KMeans provides a clear partitioning of individuals into discrete clusters, it relies on a pre-specified number of clusters and assumes spherical group shapes. To complement and possibly refine these findings, we now turn to hierarchical clustering, which offers a more flexible, nested representation of similarity among individuals‚Äîallowing us to explore multiscale structure and cluster stability without committing upfront to a fixed number of groups.\n",
